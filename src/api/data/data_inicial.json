Son of [a=Daniel Bangalter] AKA [a=Daniel Vangarde], who composed [r=187160] for [a=Ottawan].\r\nAfter the experience of [a=Darlin'] and before the [a=Daft Punk] phenomenon, Thomas Bangalter released the two famous EPs 'Trax On Da Rocks', a composite of various samples set to funky House and Techno beats.\r\n\r\nHe released 'Music Sounds Better With You' on his own label [l=Roulé] as part of [a=Stardust] as well as his remix for \"Rock Shock\" by [a=Roy Davis Jr.].\r\n\r\nIn 1998, his track 'Gym Tonic' was the center of controversy as [a=Bob Sinclar] included it on his album \"Paradise\" without the consent of Bangalter. This resulted in a lawsuit from fitness guru and actress Jane Fonda, whose voice had been illegally sampled on the record.\r\n\r\nA very 'anonymous' person, Bangalter nontheless has given a few interviews in and out of the [a=Daft Punk] phenomenon. Although a lot of people credit him for the invention of 'filtered house', he has cited [a=Carl Craig] AKA [a=Paperclip People] (\"Throw\") and [a=Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez] as precursors of the style.\r\nIt must also be noted that outside [a=Daft Punk], Bangalter stopped his DJing career due to ear problems. \r\n\r\nBangalter is married to French actress [a=Elodie Bouchez] with whom he has two sons: Tara-Jay (born 2002) and Roxan (born 2008).",

            "perfil": "British electronic musician and producer (b. 3 March 1983, King's Lynn, Norfolk). Nathan Fake produced five full-length albums, numerous EPs and remix commissions. He's been signed by [l=Ninja Tune] since 2016 and lives and works in Norwich. Fake's latest long-playing record, [i][m=1720532][/i] CD/2xLP, came out in April 2020 via [b][l=Cambria Instruments][/b] label, which Nathan co-founded in 2014.\r\n\r\nNathan Fake grew up in Norfolk and began making music in high school, inspired by IDM acts like [a=Aphex Twin] and [a=Orbital] on the radio and further reading about the artists and their gear in music magazines. In 2003, Nathan met [a=James Holden], who signed an aspiring producer on his [b][l=Border Community][/b] label, releasing [i][r=193039][/i] 12\" EP. More records soon followed on [a=Satoshi Tomiie]'s US-based [l=Saw Recordings], [l=Traum Schallplatten] in Cologne, Germany, and [l=Electrochoc Records] in France. Nathan Fake continued working with Border Community, producing two more EPs in 2004–05, leading to his debut full-length studio album, [i][m=24253][/i] 2x12\"/CD, in March 2006. The record gained positive reviews from [url=https://discogs.com/label/183279]Pitchfork[/url], [l=The Guardian], and other publications; [l=Mixmag] mentioned it on the list of top albums of the year.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Nathan Fake co-founded [b][l=Cambria Instruments][/b] with [a=Wesley Matsell], fellow Border Community alumni. Inaugurated with their [i][r=5991338][/i] split 12\" in August, the new imprint soon presented Nathan's solo [i][r=6610991][/i] 12\" EP. As a prolific remix producer, Nathan Fake has collaborated with major and independent acts and labels, from [a=Radiohead] to [a=Jon Hopkins] and [a=Chris Clark], [l69345], [l=Warp Records], and [l=Kompakt].\r\n\r\nIn September 2016, one of the leading UK electronic labels, [l=Ninja Tune], signed Nathan Fake and released his [i][r=9442223][/i] 12\" EP later the same year. He released the fourth long-playing album, [i][m=1148009][/i] 2xLP/CD, in the spring of 2017, featuring [a=Prurient] (founder of [a=Hospital Productions]) and [a=Raphaelle Standell-Preston] (of [a=Braids]) as guest musicians. This record further strengthened Fake's reputation, with favorable media coverage from [l98607] and [l=Wire Magazine] and such accolades as DJ Mag's \"Album of the Month\" or [url=https://discogs.com/label/153965]Bleep[/url]'s \"Album of the Week.\" A few notable DJs who supported Fake's tracks were [a=Ben UFO] and [a=Helena Hauff]. Later that year, Ninja Tune released a two-part [i]Providence Reworks[/i] with remixes from [a=Overmono], [a=Huerco S.], [a=Olga Wojciechowska] and [a=Konx-Om-Pax].",

This type of mushroom is notable for the misty cloud created when it releases its spores.\r\nThere is also an obvious hallucinogenic double meaning to the name. Or perhaps a reference to the plume of smoke during an atomic explosion.\r\nAlso, \"Eple\" from the first album translates to English as Apple.\r\n",

It is widely accepted that his style of DJing and his selection and the appeal of the Warehouse gave house music its name, although in the beginning, the word 'house' was used only in Chicago to denote something which was cool, hip, fresh or bad. Knuckles had been long time friends with [a=Larry Levan], they had had their musical upbringing together from going to clubs like Loft and the Gallery.\r\n\r\nDue to his importance in the development of house, Knuckles was often known as \"The Godfather of House Music\", and as such the city of Chicago named a stretch of street and a day after Knuckles in 2004. His accomplishments earned him a Grammy Award in 1997. As well, Knuckles was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for his achievements in 2005.",

The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. They have since finished recording their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, which was released in November 2010. On March 22, 2013, the band announced their break up. On October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion, with an opening show in Los Angeles. ",

            "perfil": "Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter [a=Mikael Åkerfeldt] has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of [i]Blackwater Park[/i], they have led several world tours.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, they published [i]Heritage[/i]. It represents a drastic change in style from their previous albums, adopting a mostly progressive rock sound and only clean singing. Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: \"I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.\" (Metal Hammer)\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled [i]Pale Communion[/i]. Fredrik Åkesson, spoke about the new direction the band was taking: \"It would be interesting to do a really heavy album, but in a different way. Not to go back, we're not about that. I'm still very proud with the last two albums, I think it's interesting to listen to them, even if I listen in an objective way.\" (Ultimate Guitar)\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Opeth founded their own label, [l1067696] and published the twelfth studio album \"Sorceress.\"",

She later recorded the vocal tracks individually. Nonetheless, this album too proved to be a big success.\r\nAfter the band split, [a=Nina Hagen] carried on solo with backing musicians, and the rest of the band renamed themselves [a=Spliff].",

A version of the band continues to tour and record, with only Gary Rossington of its original members remaining as of 2012. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.",

            "perfil": "Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by [a=Tony Iommi], [a=Ozzy Osbourne], [a=Geezer Butler] and [a=Bill Ward] in Birmingham, UK.\r\nThe band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's \"Ozzfest\" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's \"Mob Rules\" and 1992's \"Dehumanizer\") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was \"unsignable\".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released \"13\", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.

His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\r\n\r\nHe recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \"Special Citation\" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.\r\n\r\nAs his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\r\n\r\nColtrane's second wife was pianist [a=Alice Coltrane]; their son [a=Ravi Coltrane] is also a saxophonist.",

Although Lateef's main instruments were the tenor saxophone and flute, he also played oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, and also used a number of non-western instruments such as the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, xun, arghul and koto. \r\n\r\nLateef had an inquisitive spirit and was never just a bop or hard bop soloist. He did not care much for the term \"jazz\", consistently creating music that stretched (and even broken through) boundaries. A superior tenor saxophonist with a soulful sound and impressive technique, by the 1950s Lateef was one of the top flutists around. He also developed into a talented jazz soloist on the oboe, was an occasional bassoonist, and introduced such instruments as the arghul (a double clarinet that resembles a bassoon), shanai (a type of oboe), and different types of flutes. \r\n\r\nLateef played \"world music\" long before the term was coined. \r\n",

Initially known for their ironic, tongue-in-cheek take on jazz, The Lounge Lizards eventually became a showcase for John Lurie's sophisticated compositions straddling jazz and many other genres. They were active until about 1998 with the Lurie brothers as the only constant members, though many leading New York City based musicians were members of the group. The group's name was borrowed from American slang. A lounge lizard is typically depicted as a well-dressed man who frequents the establishments in which the rich gather with the intention of seducing a wealthy woman with his flattery and deceptive charm.",

He played trumpet in military bands during a stint in the Air Force from 1951–1953, before graduating from Wayne State University in 1954 with a music degree. Like other young Detroit jazz musicians, he also studied with bebop pianist [a=Barry Harris (2)].\r\n\r\nByrd's warmly burnished sound, fluent technique and aggressive-yet-graceful swing was rooted in the style of Clifford Brown, but his gangly, rhythmically loose phrasing was a unique calling card right from the get-go. As Byrd matured in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he tempered his hummingbird flourishes with a cooler sensibility and phrasing.\r\n\r\nByrd recorded prolifically both as a sideman and a leader, appearing on scores of recordings on the [l=Savoy Records], [l=Prestige], [l=Riverside Records] and [l=Blue Note] labels. He led a feisty quintet with his old pal from Detroit, baritone saxophonist [a=Pepper Adams], from 1958–1961. Byrd also gave a young pianist from Chicago named [a=Herbie Hancock] his first major exposure by hiring him in 1961.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, Byrd was proficient in church-inspired shouts, funky and sophisticated blues forms and structurally interesting originals. He had a wider field of vision than many of his peers, exemplified by his influential 1963 LP, “A New Perspective” (Blue Note), which married his small group with a gospel choir.\r\n\r\nByrd never stopped going to school. He earned a master's degree in music education from the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1950s, studied composition with the famous classical pedagogue [a=Nadia Boulanger] in France in the early 1960s, earned a law degree from Howard University in 1976 and a doctorate from Columbia Teachers College in New York in the early 1980s.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the 1960s, Byrd taught at many universities, most notably Rutgers, Howard and North Carolina Central.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1970s, Byrd had begun exploring a danceable fusion of jazz, R&B and soul. In 1973, he teamed with current and former students at Howard, where he was chairman of the black music department, to make the best-selling LP “Black Byrd”. Produced by brothers [a=Larry Mizell & Fonce Mizell], the record and its sequels elevated Byrd into a crossover star.",

Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.\r\nHe signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' als a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite.\r\n\r\nOlder brother of [a=Edgar Winter].\r\n",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

Originally with 4 members, Molino III and Wright left before the release of the band's second album in 1987. Kingsbery and LaCazio stayed on as a duo for a third album in 1989 but split up in 1990 after their Europe tour. After a 16-year hiatus, Kingsbery and LaCazio reformed Cock Robin in 2006 and released two more albums before LaCazio decided to leave in 2015 and relocate to the US. \r\n\r\nCock Robin nowadays is fronted by Peter Kingsbery with Coralie Vuillemin as vocalist during live shows. \r\n\r\nA new album was released in March 2016 with additional vocals by Agathe Cagin and Julie Wingins. Drummers Marc Jacquemin and Didier Strub also complete the band line-up for live shows. \r\n\r\nA 5-track EP was released in April 2017 with two new original tracks (one instrumental), 2 covers from Peter Kingsbery's solo albums and 1 cover from Cock Robin's first album, with new arrangements and vocals by Kingsbery and Vuillemin. \r\n\r\nIn September 2021, Cock Robin, consisting now of Kingsbery, Vuillemin and Strub, released a new 14-track album called \"Homo Alien.\"\r\n\r\nBand settings:\r\n\r\nPeter Kingsbery: Lead vocals, Keyboards, Bass.

This was the turning point of their career. They continued to be one of the leading synth groups throughout the eighties. After a long period of solo activities in the early and mid-90s Eurythmics re-united for one album and charity world tour in 1999 and in 2004 for the release of extended, remastered and repacked editions of their previous albums and a second hits compilation.
