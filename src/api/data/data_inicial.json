Consisting of members Sean O'Keeffe, Simon Colebrooke and producer Rob Playford (owner of Moving Shadow records), 2 Bad Mice were a staple on the early-to mid '90s hardcore scene and were instrumental in the music's steady mutation into jungle/drum'n'bass. The group's influential approach to sampled beats -- cutting them up into shards of rhythm and rearranging them in novel combinations (first appearing in mature form on the 1992 hit \"Bombscare\") is generally considered the blueprint from which jungle's characteristic manipulation of breaks was assembled. \r\n\r\nAlthough 2 Bad Mice for the most part stopped producing as the hardcore scene began to wane (Playford focusing his energy on Moving Shadow, now one of the most influential jungle labels), a best-of compilation of the group's work appeared on the American Sm:)e Communications label in 1995. These days Playford continues to work in production, while O'Keeffe, Colebrooke (and Paul Rhodes) currently DJ worldwide as 2 Bad Mice. ",

Later that year, he formed the sublabel [l=Relief Records], mostly for instrumental tracks by himself and others. \r\n\r\nBesides releases from [a=DJ Sneak], [a=Gemini], and [a=Paul Johnson], Green Velvet figured on many of the early Relief singles, including its first, \"Preacher Man\" as well as \"Flash\" (also released on the British label [l=Open]), \"The Stalker\", and \"Answering Machine\" (1997). \r\n\r\nHe began to supplement his Green Velvet DJ-ing schedule with quasi-live gigs as well, and released his first album in 1999. His self-titled release on label [l=F-111 Records] a year later compiled a dozen of his earlier club hits, and the proper sophomore production album \"Whatever\" (2001) appeared on his own Relief label. \r\n",

Around 1998 they began producing experimental, electronic and avantgarde music.\r\n\r\nSince 2000 the core of the band consists of Kristoffer Rygg, Tore Ylwizaker and Jørn H. Sværen. The three however collaborate with various musicians on their albums depending on the needs of the musical project at hand.\r\n\r\nUlver means \"Wolves\" in Norwegian.",

ELpH is the entity Coil use to describe what musical compositions come out of the equipment that are sometimes unrehearsed or consciously thought of.\r\n\r\nDuring the studio sessions that developed into what would become \"Worship the Glitch\", Coil became aware of random compositions emitting from their gear, and were at odds with constant \"accidents\" that were perpetually plaguing the recordings. The band called these unintentional emissions \"ELpH\": a conceptual being that is one part physical equipment, one part celestial being...  constantly playing the role of trickster, throwing a wrench into Coil's methodology. Eventually, these accidents and mistakes were embraced by the band, and the process of misusing audio software to create intentional \"errors\" was adopted as a musical technique. The acceptance of the \"mistake\", and the use of discovered mistakes as intentional elements slowly became the drive and concept behind the album, thus birthing the title \"Worship the Glitch\".",

            "perfil": "Born: October 29, 1969, Bristol, England\r\n\r\nBristol native Roni Size is one of the U.K. jungle scene's most respected names, with production credits spanning dozens of labels, projects and releases. Size's influence as a producer, label owner, and committed underground magnate figured him as one of the emerging sound's true pioneers. The breakout success of his debut album New Forms finally confirmed his stature and vaulted him to a greater degree of popularity than any drum'n'bass producer. \r\nBorn to Jamaican immigrant parents, Roni grew up in the Bristolean suburb of St. Andrews (home to Tricky, Massive Attack, and Smith & Mighty), where he learned the fundamentals of hip-hop through the area's sounds systems, house parties, and underground clubs. Expelled from school  Size started dabbling with house and reggae production in the late'80s. He hooked up with labelmates DJ Krust, Suv, and DJ Die at the 1990 Glastonbury Festival, and the four stayed in contact, eventually forming Size's longest running musical commitment to date: his own Full Cycle label. \r\nAlthough hardly popular in the days before ragga (then jump-up) ruled the decks, the crew now counts a number of classics among their credits, including Size's \"It's a Jazz Thing,\" Krust's \"Jazz Note,\" and Reprazent's Reasons for Sharing EP, the crew's first outing through major label subsidiary Talkin' Loud. The success of 1997's New Forms launched Size to the top of the electronica genre, and the Dope Dragon label also continues to rise in the ranks of dubplate hysteria, with tracks from Selector Owoy, Gang Related, and Mask consistently passing muster on most DJ's decks. After a relatively silent 1998, Size returned in 1999 with a new project -- Breakbeat Era, with DJ Die and vocalist Leonie Laws. The trio released Ultra-Obscene in the fall of that year. In 2000, Size returned to the Reprazent project with In the Mode, boasting sit-ins from Method Man and ex-Rage Against the Machine's Zack De La Rocha.\r\n\r\nHis brother was jungle recordings artist [a=4-Tree].",

            "perfil": "Commix is the 170bpm creative home for George Levings, and a name synonymous with the very best in forward thinking Drum & Bass.\r\n\r\nStarting out as a trio, the Commix name has graced some of Drum & Bass’ leading labels since coming to prominence in the early 2000’s, and the debut album, ‘Call To Mind’, holds the honour of being the first solo artist album for historic label Metalheadz. The lead single, 'Be True', has long since cemented its place in Drum & Bass history as an anthem on the grandest scale, and the album itself was incredibly well received across the electronic music spectrum and is widely regarded as one of the best D&B LPs of all time.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ his focus is on the deep, the experimental and the musical. Drawing on his wealth of experience in both Drum & Bass and 4x4 based genres, he joins these styles together in a mesmerising weave, defying genre and categorisation, [s]that cements his reputation as one of the most respected artists in the scene today.[/s]\r\n\r\n[b]In June of 2023 it was brought to light that George Levings of Commix had been offering music tuition whilst not providing the lessons over a three year period, amounting in ~£10000 debt owed to 25 people. This has caused the record labels Metalheadz and Hospital Records to remove Commix from their artist rosters, and his actions have caused the Drum and Bass community to distance themselves from the name Commix. The initial information about this controversy was on DOA (Dogs On Acid), the main Drum and Bass online forum.[/b]\r\n\r\n",

Rupert Parkes (associated with Ipswich in the nineties) is best known for his role in developing the \"intelligent\" drum & bass genre. Over the course of his career as Photek, Parkes has developed a sound that is simultaneously individual, innovative and accessible, earning him much respect and popularity amongst critics and music fans alike. The strength of the sound finds foundation in Photek’s incredibly detailed drum programming, which is then augmented by his sophisticated sense for combining abstract sounds with jazz and classic techno influences. \r\n\r\nRecently Parkes has been more and more active in producing music for film, having worked on a number of scoring projects for upcoming features from his new home base in Los Angeles. His dedication to film scoring is evident, and his perfectionist attention to detail and tireless work ethic are quickly leading him to success in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThe world eagerly waits to see if he'll ever release a new D&B album someday. He hasn't released a new D&B album in over 20 years.",

James Alexander (Bass) was also one of the original members but was not aboard the plane because of limited seats on Redding's plane. For Alexander and Cauley and new members Michael Toles, Willie Hall, Ronnie Gordon and Harvey Henderson, the track 'Sang & Dance' was one of the first tracks from the new group, cut in late 1969.",

            "perfil": "German artist and producer, born 29 April 1972 in Frankfurt am Main. He is the founder of [l=Psi49Net], [l=Datapunk], [l=Stahl Industries], [l=Telekraft Recordings], [l=Nextdata], [l=Studiophysik] and [l=Ghost Archive].\r\n\r\nAnthony Rother made his name on the German electro scene with two releases: “Sex with the Machines” (1997) and “Simulationszeitalter” (2000). The producer from Offenbach, Germany, founded his own record label “Psi49Net” in 1998, before establishing himself on the international electro music scene with the electro pop project “Little Computer People” (2001), the album “Hacker” (2002) and more.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Rother founded “Datapunk”, another artistic platform which allowed him to take his sound in a different direction to that of “Psi49Net”. This label saw the birth of albums such as “Popkiller” and “Super Space Model” (2006), which were loved by critics and listeners alike. In producing “Moderntronic” in 2007, Rother took his music in a new direction: a mixture of electro and techno. His first entirely digitally-produced album, “My Name Is Beuys Von Telekraft”, followed in 2008. The sound embodied by the first “Popkiller” album was followed up in 2010 by a sequel, “Popkiller II”, which also serves as a look back at the development of his music. Rother continued by exploring his experimental side on a succession of CDs released by the Frankfurt-based label Fax Records. These included the album “62 Minutes on Mars” which sold out within just a short matter of time. He then proceeded to reinvent himself in 2014, taking a completely new direction with the albums “Netzwerk der Zukunft” (Psi49net) and “Verbalizer” (Nextdata, founded especially for this song). This served to show that Rother’s creativity abounds, even 20 years after starting out in electronic music.\r\n\r\nAlongside his international DJ appearances, Rother has long been one of the most popular live acts on the electronic dance scene. For many years, Rother – along with his extensive equipment – was a frequent guest in scene clubs and at festivals all around the world. His new musical concept “Studiophysik” has yet again seen him take a brand new artistic direction. Rother produces brand-new exclusive tracks ahead of his appearances, before remixing them in real time so that his crowds can experience music mixed especially for one single gig. As Rother said in 2015, “I do not compromise or impose time limits on my musical imagination. The audience is a direct part of this artistic programme, which is tailored especially to them”. Since 2014, he is again hosting a variety of events across the Rhein-Main area, giving a new home to high-quality electronic dance tunes.\r\n\r\nSince starting out in 1993, Anthony Rother is in demand as a co-producer and remix artist, having worked with a number of prominent artists on the electro scene. He has worked on projects with former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos, as well as frequent collaborations, both productions and remixes, with Sven Väth. These appear on the albums “Contact” and “Fire”, and also as singles and maxi releases. Rother has also worked on remix projects with Nena, DJ Hell, Tiefschwarz, Ellen Alien, Thomas Schumacher and rock institution, the U.S. band AUX-88.\r\n",

The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. They have since finished recording their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, which was released in November 2010. On March 22, 2013, the band announced their break up. On October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion, with an opening show in Los Angeles. ",

            "perfil": "Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter [a=Mikael Åkerfeldt] has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of [i]Blackwater Park[/i], they have led several world tours.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, they published [i]Heritage[/i]. It represents a drastic change in style from their previous albums, adopting a mostly progressive rock sound and only clean singing. Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: \"I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.\" (Metal Hammer)\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled [i]Pale Communion[/i]. Fredrik Åkesson, spoke about the new direction the band was taking: \"It would be interesting to do a really heavy album, but in a different way. Not to go back, we're not about that. I'm still very proud with the last two albums, I think it's interesting to listen to them, even if I listen in an objective way.\" (Ultimate Guitar)\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Opeth founded their own label, [l1067696] and published the twelfth studio album \"Sorceress.\"",

She later recorded the vocal tracks individually. Nonetheless, this album too proved to be a big success.\r\nAfter the band split, [a=Nina Hagen] carried on solo with backing musicians, and the rest of the band renamed themselves [a=Spliff].",

A version of the band continues to tour and record, with only Gary Rossington of its original members remaining as of 2012. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.",

Their early music (Sorry Ma, Forgot To Take Out The Trash and Stink EP) was influenced by American hardcore (like their contemporaries Hüsker Dü) with later albums slowing down tempo. Bob Stinson left the band in 1986, and was later replaced by Slim Dunlap. The band broke up in 1991 due to internal tensions. In 2006, the surviving members (without the original drummer Chris Mars, and without Bob Stinson who died in 1995) gathered together and recorded some new tracks for a Replacements compilation. On 3 October 2012, it was announced that The Replacements were active again.",

            "perfil": "Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by [a=Tony Iommi], [a=Ozzy Osbourne], [a=Geezer Butler] and [a=Bill Ward] in Birmingham, UK.\r\nThe band's original name was the [b]Polka Tulk Blues Band[/b] (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later on changed to [b][a=Earth (12)][/b] before becoming [b]Black Sabbath[/b] inspired by an Italian horror movie of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's \"Ozzfest\" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's \"Mob Rules\" and 1992's \"Dehumanizer\") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was \"unsignable\".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released \"13\", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. During the years 1968 to 2017, Black Sabbath has recorded 19 studio albums.\r\n\r\nLine-Ups:\r\nGuitar:\r\n[a=Tony Iommi] - 1968-2017\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\n[a=Ozzy Osbourne] - 1968-1977, 1978-1979, 1997-2017\r\n[a=Dave Walker (6)] - 1977-1978 (rehearsals and a TV appearance only)\r\n[a=Ronnie James Dio] - 1979-1982, 1991-1992\r\n[a=Ian Gillan] - 1983-1984\r\n[a=Glenn Hughes] - 1985-1986\r\n[a=Ray Gillen] - 1986-1987 (live only)\r\n[a=Tony Martin] - 1987-1991, 1993-1996\r\n\r\nBass:\r\n[a=Geezer Butler] - 1968-1984, 1991-1994, 1997-2017\r\n[a=Craig Gruber] - 1979 (rehearsals only while Butler contemplated leaving the band, the extent of his participation has been disputed)\r\n[a=Gordon Copley] -1985 (rehearsals and one studio track only)\r\n[a=Dave Spitz] \"The Beast\"  - 1985-1986, 1987 (live appearances only in 1987)\r\n[a=Bob Daisley] - 1987 (studio only)\r\n[a=Jo Burt] - 1987 (live only)\r\n[a=Laurence Cottle] - 1988 (studio only)\r\n[a=Neil Murray] - 1989-1992, 1995-1996\r\n\r\nDrums:\r\n[a=Bill Ward] - 1968-1980, 1983 (studio only in 1983), 1994 (live appearances), 1997-2011\r\n[a=Vinny Appice] - 1981-1982, 1991-1992, 1998 (live only in 1998, filling in for a sick Bill Ward)\r\n[a=Bev Bevan] - 1983-1984, 1987 (live only)\r\n[a=Eric Singer] - 1985-1987\r\n[a=Terry Chimes] - 1987-1988 (live only)\r\n[a=Cozy Powell] - 1988-1991, 1994-1995\r\n[a=Bobby Rondinelli] - 1993-1994, 1995 (live appearances only in 1995)\r\n[a=Mike Bordin] - 1997 (live only, not a full member)\r\n[a=Brad Wilk] - 2013 (studio only, not a full member)\r\n[a=Tommy Clufetos] - 2012-2017 (live only, not a full member)\r\n\r\nKeyboards:\r\n[a=Rick Wakeman] - 1973 (studio only, not a full member)\r\n[a=Jezz Woodroffe] - ?-1977 (not a full member)\r\n[a=Don Airey] - 1978 (not a full member)\r\n[a=Geoff Nicholls] - 1979-2004\r\n[a=Adam Wakeman] - 2004-2017 (live only, not a full member)",

            "perfil": "This page is for the band King Diamond.  All credits for the person King Diamond are to be put under [a=King Diamond (2)].\r\n\r\nThe King Diamond band was formed in 1985 by Danish vocalist King Diamond following the break-up of his previous band, [a=Mercyful Fate].  The original line-up consisted of Diamond, his former Mercyful Fate bandmates Michael Denner (guitar) and Timi Hansen (bass), and Swedes Mikkey Dee (drums) and Andy LaRoque (guitar).  This line-up lasted for two albums before Denner and Hansen departed, the first of many line-up changes for the band.  To date, LaRoque is the only musician besides King Diamond to appear on every King Diamond band release.\r\n\r\nWith the King Diamond band, Diamond traded the occult-based and blasphemous lyrics of Mercyful Fate for a gothic horror approach.  Almost all of the lyrics on King Diamond's albums revolve around a specific story.  Only the band's debut, \"Fatal Portrait,\" and 1995's \"Spider's Lullaby\" stray from this formula, although, even in those cases, several of the songs on the albums feature lyrics that are related to each other.  In 2003, Hungarian vocalist Livia Zita was brought onboard to provide female vocals.  It marked the first time that King Diamond worked with another vocalist on any of his projects (excluding any guest appearances he made on other artists' projects).  King and Livia were later married.\r\n\r\nThe group saw their commercial success reach its peak in the mid and late 1980's, and their second album, \"Abigail\" is considered a heavy metal classic.  The group was also a target for parents' and watchdog groups who objected to King Diamond's image and what they perceived to be questionable content (although the latter was mostly based on the King's work with Mercyful Fate and his personal connections to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan).  The band has continued to work steadily, although they have been on hold in recent years because of King Diamond's health issues, which include back surgery in 2007, and a triple-bypass in 2010.",

The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. They have since finished recording their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, which was released in November 2010. On March 22, 2013, the band announced their break up. On October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion, with an opening show in Los Angeles. ",

Throughout their career the band have confounded fans and critics alike with their perpetual taste for reinvention and experimentation, a desire to work with producers from other musical genres, and an oft-stated refusal to repeat themselves for fear of stagnation. \r\n[r=367482], [r=367141] and [r=786362] established the band as one of death/doom's leading forces but by 1993's [r=785934] they were gradually moving away these influences and instead opting for a more melancholy, slightly goth-influenced (though still metal) mainstream sound, they continued this trend on the extremely popular (albeit controversial) [r=786348] and [r=771025] then losing almost all metallic ties on albums such as [r=628050] and [r=511776]. 2002's [r=508392] saw the band begin to revert to its goth rock and heavy metal roots, subsequent releases have charted the band's exploration back into gothic and heavy metal territory.",

They were shortly after joined by [a=John Tatum] on rhythm guitar and [a=John Speer] on drums and became [a=Spiders] in the fall of 1965. [a=Michael Bruce] replaced Tatum on guitar in 1966. The band relocated to Los Angeles in March 1967, changed their name to [a=The Nazz] in April. Fellow Phoenix musician and friend [a=Neal Smith] moved in with the band in September 1967 and replaced Speer as drummer later that fall. By March of 1968 the band changed their name again, becoming [a=Alice Cooper] to prevent confusion with [a=Todd Rundgren]'s group [a=Nazz].\r\n\r\nLead singer Furnier took on the identity of Alice Cooper onstage and the band went on to become one of the most popular rock bands of the early seventies.  Their overblown stage presence basically created shock rock and was hugely influential on the rock scene that followed.\r\n\r\nThe band split in 1974, initially taking a hiatus with several members working on solo projects.  Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper in 1975, and launched a successful solo career.  Bruce, Dunaway and Smith went on to form [a=Billion Dollar Babies], named after the most popular Alice Cooper album.",

The band consists of Matthew Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, piano), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums, backing vocals). Dan Lancaster joins Muse on live stage since 2022 (previously Morgan Nicholls) for additional instruments and vocals.\r\n\r\nMuse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.\r\n\r\nBlack Holes & Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, was released on November 9th, 2018. Will of the People, their latest to date album, was released on August 26th, 2022 and is inspired by the current years events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, riots, Black Lives Matter movement, and so on.\r\n\r\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhen marked as a copyright holder, use [l621514].",

His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\r\n\r\nHe recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \"Special Citation\" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.\r\n\r\nAs his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\r\n\r\nColtrane's second wife was pianist [a=Alice Coltrane]; their son [a=Ravi Coltrane] is also a saxophonist.",

Although Lateef's main instruments were the tenor saxophone and flute, he also played oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, and also used a number of non-western instruments such as the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, xun, arghul and koto. \r\n\r\nLateef had an inquisitive spirit and was never just a bop or hard bop soloist. He did not care much for the term \"jazz\", consistently creating music that stretched (and even broken through) boundaries. A superior tenor saxophonist with a soulful sound and impressive technique, by the 1950s Lateef was one of the top flutists around. He also developed into a talented jazz soloist on the oboe, was an occasional bassoonist, and introduced such instruments as the arghul (a double clarinet that resembles a bassoon), shanai (a type of oboe), and different types of flutes. \r\n\r\nLateef played \"world music\" long before the term was coined. \r\n",

They were active until about 1998 with the Lurie brothers as the only constant members, though many leading New York City based musicians were members of the group. The group's name was borrowed from American slang. A lounge lizard is typically depicted as a well-dressed man who frequents the establishments in which the rich gather with the intention of seducing a wealthy woman with his flattery and deceptive charm.",

He played trumpet in military bands during a stint in the Air Force from 1951–1953, before graduating from Wayne State University in 1954 with a music degree. Like other young Detroit jazz musicians, he also studied with bebop pianist [a=Barry Harris (2)].\r\n\r\nByrd's warmly burnished sound, fluent technique and aggressive-yet-graceful swing was rooted in the style of Clifford Brown, but his gangly, rhythmically loose phrasing was a unique calling card right from the get-go. As Byrd matured in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he tempered his hummingbird flourishes with a cooler sensibility and phrasing.\r\n\r\nByrd recorded prolifically both as a sideman and a leader, appearing on scores of recordings on the [l=Savoy Records], [l=Prestige], [l=Riverside Records] and [l=Blue Note] labels. He led a feisty quintet with his old pal from Detroit, baritone saxophonist [a=Pepper Adams], from 1958–1961. Byrd also gave a young pianist from Chicago named [a=Herbie Hancock] his first major exposure by hiring him in 1961.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, Byrd was proficient in church-inspired shouts, funky and sophisticated blues forms and structurally interesting originals. He had a wider field of vision than many of his peers, exemplified by his influential 1963 LP, “A New Perspective” (Blue Note), which married his small group with a gospel choir.\r\n\r\nByrd never stopped going to school. He earned a master's degree in music education from the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1950s, studied composition with the famous classical pedagogue [a=Nadia Boulanger] in France in the early 1960s, earned a law degree from Howard University in 1976 and a doctorate from Columbia Teachers College in New York in the early 1980s.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the 1960s, Byrd taught at many universities, most notably Rutgers, Howard and North Carolina Central.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1970s, Byrd had begun exploring a danceable fusion of jazz, R&B and soul. In 1973, he teamed with current and former students at Howard, where he was chairman of the black music department, to make the best-selling LP “Black Byrd”. Produced by brothers [a=Larry Mizell & Fonce Mizell], the record and its sequels elevated Byrd into a crossover star.",

His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\r\n\r\nHe recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \"Special Citation\" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.\r\n\r\nAs his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\r\n\r\nColtrane's second wife was pianist [a=Alice Coltrane]; their son [a=Ravi Coltrane] is also a saxophonist.",

While attending Texas Southern University, they met [a=Wayne Henderson] (trombone) and with two others formed the Modern Jazz Sextet. 1958 saw the future Jazz Crusaders Sample, Felder, Hooper and Henderson drop out of college and move to Los Angeles, where they performed as The Nite Hawks. In 1960, they returned to jazz and formed the Jazz Crusaders as a quintet with a succession of different bass players, landing a contract with [l=World Pacific Jazz] in 1961. As the 1960s progressed their hard bop stylings evolved  with the times incorporating more of a soul-jazz feeling. Shortening their name to The Crusaders in 1971, most of the 1970's saw them with [l=Blue Thumb Records], by which time they had become even funkier utilizing the guitar vamps of new member [a=Larry Carlton]. Their best-known hit “Street Life” was responsible for bringing guest vocalist [a=Randy Crawford] to the public attention. The group is perhaps best remembered as backing musicians on more the 200 gold records, backing Steely Dan, Curtis Mayfield, Joni Mitchell, Ray Charles, & Van Morrison to name a few.",

He is often regarded as one of the founders of bebop. Monk's prolific compositions and improvisations are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists.  His  unorthodox approach to the piano combines a highly percussive attack with abrupt, use of silence and dramatic pauses. He was also known for a distinct fashion sense in his suits, hats and trademark sunglasses. Monk was an unconventional stage presence, known for getting up from his piano to dance (sometimes in a counter-clockwise motion  which drew comparisons to ring-shout and Muslim Sufi whirling) while his band members were still playing. Monk is one of only five jazz musicians to date to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, which puts him in a select company with [a=Louis Armstrong], [a=Duke Ellington], [a=Wynton Marsalis], and [a=Dave Brubeck].\r\n\r\nFather of [a=Thelonious Monk Jr.] and [a=Boo Boo Monk].",

            "perfil": "Mulatu Astatke (Amharic: ሙላቱ አስታጥቄ; also written Astatqé on French releases) is arguably one of the most influential and legendary musicians from Ethiopia. During the 1960’s, he studied music abroad in London, Boston, and New York. He then returned home to Ethiopia armed with a love for jazz and Latin music. There he blended Ethiopian traditional music with the Latin-jazz he was so fond of to create a unique hybrid he called “Ethio-jazz”.\r\nMulatu Astatke is first and foremost a composer but also a multi-instrumentalist, playing the vibraphone, keyboards and organs. He is further credited as having established congas and bongos, instruments normally central to Latin styles, in Ethiopian music. However, as Ethiopian songs traditionally focused on vocals his greatest contribution to the music of his country was introducing a new focus on instrumentation.\r\nThree of his LPs were recorded in New York City – his first two, [i]Afro-Latin Soul Volumes 1 & 2[/i] in 1966, plus later [i]Mulatu of Ethiopia[/i] in 1972. The bulk of his output was on Amha Records (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) on which he released several 7” singles as well as one LP in 1974 entitled [i]Yekatit Ethio-Jazz[/i].\r\nOf late, Mulatu Astatke has been the center of renewed attention in the West through a compilation on the Parisian series Ethiopiques (Buda Musique) and a 10” 4-track compilation on the [l=Soundway] label out of Brighton England. Most notably, a number of his tracks were also featured in director Jim Jarmush’s 2005 independent film [i]Broken Flowers[/i] with actors Bill Murray and Julie Delpy.\r\nA project to re-record some of Mulatu Astatke’s older work as well as new original material has recently been undertaken in collaboration with [a=Will Holland] of [a=Quantic] fame, drummer Max Weissenfeldt from [a=Poets Of Rhythm], trumpeter [a=Todd Simon], and Showboy from Fela Kuti’s [a=Egypt 80].\r\n\r\n[i]Background material for this artist profile originates from several sources, including the notes from Ethiopiques Vol 4 (Buda Musique) and an article by [a=Miles Cleret] in Wax Poetics (Issue #14, Fall 2005).[/i]\r\n",

His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\r\n\r\nHe recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \"Special Citation\" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.\r\n\r\nAs his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\r\n\r\nColtrane's second wife was pianist [a=Alice Coltrane]; their son [a=Ravi Coltrane] is also a saxophonist.",

This very prolific musician played anything from Bebob, Post Bop, Free Jazz, Latin Jazz and Crossover to [a95546] and [a304968], as well as solo piano improvisations, including being one of those defining Jazz Rock and Fusion in the 1970s, both solo and in [a41893] and [a342265]. He acquired his nickname from an aunt who liked to address him as “Cheeky”.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he marched as a lead soprano bugle soloist in a drum and bugle corps: [a9280684] of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Influenced by bebop, he started his professional career in the early 60s, and recorded his first album in 1966 (not released until 1968). After very well received trio Post Bop album [m115075] with drummer [a255556] and bass player [a128396], he began recording a series of groundbreaking studio and live albums with [a23755] 1968-70, before making 3 albums with Free Jazz and Fusion quartet Circle, as well as 2 solo piano improvisation albums in 1971-72. In 1971 he released the first Return to Forever album, and the band went from making Latin American acoustic and electronc music to a more Jazz Rock oriented approach during the decade. At the same time, Corea continued to explore Latin American and classical music, fusion and jazz, using mainly piano, electric piano and Minimoog. For the rest of his life, he kept on touring, recording and collaborating with numerous musicians, and was awarded 25 Emmys.\r\n\r\nChick Corea died from cancer on February 9, 2021 in Tampa, Florida. He was married to vocalist [a253240].",

            "perfil": "Glenn Miller and His Orchestra was formed by trombonist, arranger, composer, Glenn Miller.  Glenn Miller was the best-selling recording artist 1939 - 1942.  Miller was a sideman in many different groups beginning in 1926 with the Ben Pollack Orchestra.  He was overshadowed in Pollack's band by Jack Teagarden who began taking all of the trombone solos.  Miller focused on arranging and composing and by 1928 he had already published a songbook.  Miller played frequently with other sideman who would become famous in their own rights with orchestras, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman.  Making some recordings with \"Benny Goodman's Boys\" in 1928 for Brunswick, Miller was a free-lance trombonist in several bands such as Red Nichols, Joe Venuti and Nat Shilkret.  From the early to mid 30's Miller was arranger and composer for the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and made many recordings with Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters for Brunswick and Decca.  In 1935 he assembled the American orchestra for Ray Noble.  \r\nAnxious to break out on his own, Miller formed his first orchestra in 1937 and made his first recordings as the Glenn Miller Orchestra for Brunswick, Vocalion and Decca.  By 1938 the band was unsuccessful and starving to death and disbanded.  He revamped his style and arranging and credited the second and massively popular Glenn Miller Orchestra.  \r\nIn September 1938 they made their first in a long list of recordings for Victor subsidiary Bluebird Records. In the spring of 1939, after a stint at the Meadowbrook Ballroom and Glen Island Casino, their popularity soared.  By 1939 Miller's band was tops in the jukeboxes and was the most popular orchestra until 1942 when Miller went into the service during WWII.  From Dec 1939 - September 1942 Miller had a radio program broadcast 3 times a week.  His records sold millions and was awarded the first gold record for \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" in 1941 as well as being seen in a few motion pictures.  \r\n\r\nBy Joel Whitburn's tabulation, in less than four years the group saw 16 US number-one hits, as well as 6 Australian number-ones (three of which didn't hit top the US charts). The amount of hit singles Miller and His Orchestra had in such a short amount of time proved to be one of the greatest chart runs in history. \"In the Mood\" became an anthem of the swing craze and the most lasting of even his biggest records. The group sold over 60 million records, the most of any dance band. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, the very patriotic Miller joined the Army Air Forces where he would develop a modern military band for morale raising. The orchestra disbanded to a very emotional crowd at the Central Theater in Passaic, NJ on September 27, 1942.  On December 15, 1944, Miller mysteriously disappeared over the English Channel. He was recognized as war hero. The band's music never left the American public; Despite never recording a studio album, Miller and His Orchestra had three posthumous Billboard number-one compilation albums as well as album certifications spanning several countries several decades years after his death at age 40.\r\n\r\n[b] Use [a=The Glenn Miller Orchestra] for recordings WITHOUT [a=Glenn Miller] (who died in 1944).\r\nSee also: [a=The New Glenn Miller Orchestra] [/b]",

This very prolific musician played anything from Bebob, Post Bop, Free Jazz, Latin Jazz and Crossover to [a95546] and [a304968], as well as solo piano improvisations, including being one of those defining Jazz Rock and Fusion in the 1970s, both solo and in [a41893] and [a342265]. He acquired his nickname from an aunt who liked to address him as “Cheeky”.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he marched as a lead soprano bugle soloist in a drum and bugle corps: [a9280684] of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Influenced by bebop, he started his professional career in the early 60s, and recorded his first album in 1966 (not released until 1968). After very well received trio Post Bop album [m115075] with drummer [a255556] and bass player [a128396], he began recording a series of groundbreaking studio and live albums with [a23755] 1968-70, before making 3 albums with Free Jazz and Fusion quartet Circle, as well as 2 solo piano improvisation albums in 1971-72. In 1971 he released the first Return to Forever album, and the band went from making Latin American acoustic and electronc music to a more Jazz Rock oriented approach during the decade. At the same time, Corea continued to explore Latin American and classical music, fusion and jazz, using mainly piano, electric piano and Minimoog. For the rest of his life, he kept on touring, recording and collaborating with numerous musicians, and was awarded 25 Emmys.\r\n\r\nChick Corea died from cancer on February 9, 2021 in Tampa, Florida.

An accomplished pianist and one of the few harpists in the history of jazz, she recorded many albums as a bandleader, beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s for Impulse! and other record labels. She was married to jazz saxophonist and composer [a97545], with whom she performed in 1966–1967. One of the foremost proponents of spiritual jazz, her eclectic music proved widely influential both within and outside the world of jazz.\r\n\r\nColtrane's professional music career slowed from the mid 1970s as she became more dedicated to her religious education. She founded the Vedantic Center in 1975 and the Shanti Anantam Ashram in California in 1983, where she served as spiritual director. On July 3, 1994, Swamini rededicated and inaugurated the land as Sai Anantam Ashram. During the 1980s and 1990s, she recorded several albums of Hindu devotional songs before returning to jazz in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nShe was taught to play the harp by Velma Froude at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, who had instructed [a91960] a couple of years earlier.",

An accomplished pianist and one of the few harpists in the history of jazz, she recorded many albums as a bandleader, beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s for Impulse! and other record labels. She was married to jazz saxophonist and composer [a97545], with whom she performed in 1966–1967. One of the foremost proponents of spiritual jazz, her eclectic music proved widely influential both within and outside the world of jazz.\r\n\r\nColtrane's professional music career slowed from the mid 1970s as she became more dedicated to her religious education. She founded the Vedantic Center in 1975 and the Shanti Anantam Ashram in California in 1983, where she served as spiritual director. On July 3, 1994, Swamini rededicated and inaugurated the land as Sai Anantam Ashram. During the 1980s and 1990s, she recorded several albums of Hindu devotional songs before returning to jazz in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nShe was taught to play the harp by Velma Froude at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, who had instructed [a91960] a couple of years earlier.",

Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.\r\nHe signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' als a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite.\r\n\r\nOlder brother of [a=Edgar Winter].\r\n",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

When he returned home to New Orleans in 1918 he discovered that his entire family had been killed by a flu epidemic except for one brother. He and his surviving brother, [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/683139]James \"Steady Roll\" Johnson[/url], moved to St. Louis in 1920 where Lonnie played with [a339900] and with [a4900280] in their Mississippi riverboat bands. In 1925 Johnson married blues singer [a859572] and won a blues contest sponsored by the Okeh record company. Part of the prize was a recording deal with the company. Throughout the rest of the 1920s he recorded with a variety of bands and musicians, including [a=Eddie Lang], [a253858] and the [a284747]. In the 1930s Johnson moved to Cleveland, Ohio and worked with the [a3232783], and then in a tire factory and steel mill. In 1937 he moved back to Chicago and played with [a=Johnny Dodds] and [a=Jimmie Noone]. Johnson continued to play for the rest of his life, but was often forced to leave the music business for periods to make a living. In 1963 he once again appeared briefly with [a=Duke Ellington].",

            "perfil": "Blues and gospel singer and songwriter, playing both guitar and piano. Known for his distinctive falsetto vocals and minor-key guitar sound, played in an open D-minor tuning.\r\n\r\nBorn: June 21, 1902, in Yazoo City, Mississippi.\r\nDied: October 3, 1969, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Cancer)\r\n\r\nRaised on the Woodbine plantation just outside Betonia, Mississippi, James was drawn to music from an early age. As a child he was inspired to be a musician after he heard Henry Stuckey and Rich Griffin play a Saturday night dance party.  He taught himself piano after watching a rural pianist, and developed his guitar style after Stuckey showed him how to tune his guitar to an open E minor chord. \r\n\r\nIn 1927, Okeh Records approached him about making some records, but James refused. James was finally persuaded to see H.C. Spier in February of 1931, a master talent scout who had discovered most of the greatest Mississippi bluesmen of the 1920s and early 1930s. James played a little bit of \"Devil Got My Woman,\" and Spier was convinced. The next day he presented the singer with a contract and a train ticket to Grafton, Wisconsin, where Paramount Records had a studio. James apparently recorded 18 tunes, though he would later remember performing 26 songs.\r\n\r\nNot long after his recording session, James met his father again for the first time since his childhood. The senior James was a Baptist minister, and asked Skip to go to Dallas to attend his divinity school and study for the ministry. James accepted the invitation. The most serious implication of his new-found religion was relinquishing the blues, which was considered the Devil's music. H.C. Spier again approached James in 1932 about recording for Victor Records, but James refused.\r\n\r\nIn 1948 James quit a job with a mining company in Birmingham and returned to Betonia, planning to resume his blues career, but the African American population in Mississippi was dwindling and tastes in blues had changed, as well.  He was only able to play an occasional party in town, and eventually vanished.  Biographer Stephen Calt speculated that James' nickname may have had its roots in his criminal activities as he claimed that James often had to \"skip\" town in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1964 that blues enthusiasts Bill Barth, John Fahey, and Henry Vestine located James in Tunica, Arkansas, where he lay in a hospital suffering from cancer. Finally coaxed back to performing, his first public appearance was the Newport Folk Festival that year. James frequently refused offers to be recorded and embraced his rediscovery in the 1960s only halfheartedly.\r\n\r\nIn constant pain from cancer, James was unable to record at first, despite interest from various record companies. In July of 1965, he received $200 for a session for [l73607], which later that year resulted in his first album [m=363263]. He would later record two LPs for [l1058], [m=275572] and [m=266649]. \r\n\r\nDuring the last four years of his life he occasionally played gigs at coffeehouses up and down the northeast coast. But his unrelentingly depressing music made the clubs loathe to book him, and his records were not particularly successful.\r\n\r\nLiving in Philadelphia with his third wife, James was chronically broke during his last years, until the group [a229621] recorded \"I'm So Glad\" and included James' songwriter's credit.\r\n\r\nHe was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1992.",

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

In 1981, Lennox and Stewart made their debut as Eurythmics, though they struggled to gain recognition at first, only breaking through with their sixth single \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\". This was the turning point of their career. They continued to be one of the leading synth groups throughout the eighties. After a long period of solo activities in the early and mid-90s Eurythmics re-united for one album and charity world tour in 1999 and in 2004 for the release of extended, remastered and repacked editions of their previous albums and a second hits compilation. Eurythmics released one song (b-side of \"Put A Little Love In Your Heart\" by Annie Lennox & [a=Al Green]) under the alias \"The Spheres Of Celestial Influence\", a name considered before naming themselves Eurythmics.\r\n\r\nNote: There are combined audio & video masters for [m=72601], [m=319205] and [m=72522].",

It started a decade of almost uninterrupted string of hits and major selling albums.\r\nAfter the group stopped releasing new material in 1982 (they never officially disbanded) there was a relative lull in their popularity – which came to an end in 1992 when \"[m=12249]\" was released. The compilation has become one of the world's most best-selling albums of all time.\r\nIn 1999, a musical based on ABBA hits called 'Mamma Mia!' opened in London. With various international productions, in 50 countries in all 6 continents, it is one of the most popular musicals of all time.\r\nABBA were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, in the category of 'Performers'.\r\nABBA released a new album in November 2021.

            "perfil": "French singer and cultural icon born December 19, 1915, in Paris, and died October 11, 1963, in Plascassier.\r\n\r\nBest known for singing songs \"[r=867885]\", composed by [a=Louiguy], with lyrics by Piaf, and English lyrics adapted by [a=Mack David]; and \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Edith-Piaf-Non-Je-Ne-Regrette-Rien/master/266272]Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien[/url]\" written by [a=Michel Vaucaire], which rather fittingly she sung just two years before the end of her eventful life.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle area of Paris by nightclub owner Louis Leplée, whose club Le Gerny off the Champs-Élysées was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness, which, combined with her height of only 142 centimetres (4 ft 8 in), inspired him to give her the nickname that would stay with her for the rest of her life and serve as her stage name, La Môme Piaf (Parigot translatable as \"The Waif Sparrow\", \"The Little Sparrow\", or \"Kid Sparrow\"). Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, later to become her trademark apparel. Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including actor Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub gigs led to her first two records produced that same year, with one of them penned by Marguerite Monnot, a collaborator throughout Piaf's life.\r\n\r\nOn 6 April 1936, Leplée was murdered, and Piaf was questioned and accused as an accessory but was acquitted. Leplée had been killed by mobsters with previous ties to Piaf. A barrage of negative media attention now threatened her career. To rehabilitate her image, she recruited Raymond Asso, with whom she would become romantically involved. He changed her stage name to \"Édith Piaf\", barred undesirable acquaintances from seeing her, and commissioned Monnot to write songs that reflected or alluded to Piaf's previous life on the streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Édith co-starred in Jean Cocteau's successful one-act play \"Le Bel Indifférent\". She began forming friendships with prominent people, including Chevalier and poet Jacques Borgeat. She wrote the lyrics of many of her songs and collaborated with composers on the tunes. In 1944, she discovered Yves Montand in Paris, made him part of her act, and became his mentor and lover. Within a year, he became one of the most famous singers in France, and she broke off their relationship when he had become almost as popular as she was.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, she was in great demand and very successful in Paris as France's most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Atahualpa Yupanqui (Héctor Roberto Chavero)—the most important Argentine musician of folklore—the opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. She helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her in France and the United States and recording some of his songs. At first, she met with little success with U.S. audiences, who regarded her as downcast. After a glowing review by a prominent New York critic, however, her popularity grew, to the point where she eventually appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times and at Carnegie Hall twice (1956 and 1957).\r\n\r\nÉdith Piaf's signature song \"La Vie En Rose\" was written in 1945 and was voted a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.\r\n\r\nBruno Coquatrix's famous Paris Olympia music hall is where Piaf achieved lasting fame, giving several series of concerts at the hall, the most famous venue in Paris, between January 1955 and October 1962. Excerpts from five of these concerts (1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962) were issued on record and CD and have never been out of print. The 1961 concerts were promised by Piaf in an effort to save the venue from bankruptcy and where she debuted her song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\". In April 1963, Piaf recorded her last song, \"L'Homme De Berlin\".\r\n\r\nShe was married to [a=Jacques Pills] between 1952 and 1956, and to [a=Théo Sarapo] from 1962 until her death in 1963.",

            "perfil": "French singer and cultural icon born December 19, 1915, in Paris, and died October 11, 1963, in Plascassier.\r\n\r\nBest known for singing songs \"[r=867885]\", composed by [a=Louiguy], with lyrics by Piaf, and English lyrics adapted by [a=Mack David]; and \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Edith-Piaf-Non-Je-Ne-Regrette-Rien/master/266272]Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien[/url]\" written by [a=Michel Vaucaire], which rather fittingly she sung just two years before the end of her eventful life.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle area of Paris by nightclub owner Louis Leplée, whose club Le Gerny off the Champs-Élysées was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness, which, combined with her height of only 142 centimetres (4 ft 8 in), inspired him to give her the nickname that would stay with her for the rest of her life and serve as her stage name, La Môme Piaf (Parigot translatable as \"The Waif Sparrow\", \"The Little Sparrow\", or \"Kid Sparrow\"). Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, later to become her trademark apparel. Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including actor Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub gigs led to her first two records produced that same year, with one of them penned by Marguerite Monnot, a collaborator throughout Piaf's life.\r\n\r\nOn 6 April 1936, Leplée was murdered, and Piaf was questioned and accused as an accessory but was acquitted. Leplée had been killed by mobsters with previous ties to Piaf. A barrage of negative media attention now threatened her career. To rehabilitate her image, she recruited Raymond Asso, with whom she would become romantically involved. He changed her stage name to \"Édith Piaf\", barred undesirable acquaintances from seeing her, and commissioned Monnot to write songs that reflected or alluded to Piaf's previous life on the streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Édith co-starred in Jean Cocteau's successful one-act play \"Le Bel Indifférent\". She began forming friendships with prominent people, including Chevalier and poet Jacques Borgeat. She wrote the lyrics of many of her songs and collaborated with composers on the tunes. In 1944, she discovered Yves Montand in Paris, made him part of her act, and became his mentor and lover. Within a year, he became one of the most famous singers in France, and she broke off their relationship when he had become almost as popular as she was.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, she was in great demand and very successful in Paris as France's most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Atahualpa Yupanqui (Héctor Roberto Chavero)—the most important Argentine musician of folklore—the opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. She helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her in France and the United States and recording some of his songs. At first, she met with little success with U.S. audiences, who regarded her as downcast. After a glowing review by a prominent New York critic, however, her popularity grew, to the point where she eventually appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times and at Carnegie Hall twice (1956 and 1957).\r\n\r\nÉdith Piaf's signature song \"La Vie En Rose\" was written in 1945 and was voted a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.\r\n\r\nBruno Coquatrix's famous Paris Olympia music hall is where Piaf achieved lasting fame, giving several series of concerts at the hall, the most famous venue in Paris, between January 1955 and October 1962. Excerpts from five of these concerts (1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962) were issued on record and CD and have never been out of print. The 1961 concerts were promised by Piaf in an effort to save the venue from bankruptcy and where she debuted her song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\". In April 1963, Piaf recorded her last song, \"L'Homme De Berlin\".\r\n\r\nShe was married to [a=Jacques Pills] between 1952 and 1956, and to [a=Théo Sarapo] from 1962 until her death in 1963.",

He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with [a27518]) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's–2000's).\r\n\r\nHe was backed in the 1950's by [a=The Drifters (2)], who later changed their name to [a=The Shadows].\r\n\r\nRichard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc \"Move It\", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including \"The Young Ones\" (1962) and \"Summer Holiday\" (1963).\r\n\r\nThe late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when \"Devil Woman\" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album \"Silver\" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, \"The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook\".",

He has also set to music poems by both well-known and relatively obscure poets, including [a=Louis Aragon] (Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux), [a=Victor Hugo], [a=Jean Richepin], [a=François Villon], and [a=Guillaume Apollinaire].\r\n",

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

He then pursued a solo career. Nick Beggs took over lead vocal duties and the group released another album (they were now known as simply Kaja in North America with this release). After Jez Strode left the group before the recording of their last album, they officially shortened their name to Kaja, releasing one more album under this moniker.\r\n\r\nOctober 2003 saw the original 5 members briefly reunite as part of the VH1 'Bands Reunited' TV series, in which they performed a 1-off special show. Nick, Steve and Stuart have since remained in Kajagoogoo.\r\n\r\nLimahl and Jez joined the band again in February 2008. ",

            "perfil": "Hot Chocolate formed in Brixton, London, England. Members of the group around Errol Brown included Tony Connor, Larry Ferguson, Harvey Hinsley, Derek Lewis, Pat Olive and Tony Wilson. \r\nIn 1969 while demoing a slight reggae version of the John Lennon song \"Give Peace A Chance\" with a group of friends, Errol Brown changed the lyrics of the number but he was informed that he could not change Lennon's song without his permission! So a copy of the demo was sent to the Beatles record label, 'Apple', with fingers crossed. John Lennon loved the version and it was released on the 'Apple' label. Errol and his friends were given the name, 'The Hot Chocolate Band', a name thought up by a secretary at the company but which the band later changed to 'Hot Chocolate'. \r\nTowards the end of 1969 Mickie Most signed Errol and the cofounder of the group, Tony Wilson as writers and recorded their songs with Mary Hopkins, Julie Felix and Herman's Hermits before encouraging them to come up with a song for themselves. In 1970 'Hot Chocolate', with Errol Brown as lead singer released their first record entitled, \"Love Is Life\" which reached number 6 in the charts. This was the start of a fifteen year career for the group who amassed a total of over 30 hits and also became the only group in the UK to have a hit for fifteen consecutive years. Brown's bald headed charismatic image and unique voice being the central focus of the group along with a great song writing talent that saw him pen such pop classics as, \"It Started With A Kiss\",\"You Sexy Thing\" and \"Every 1's A Winner\". \r\nIn 1981 'Hot Chocolate' had the honour of being invited by Prince Charles and Lady Diana at their pre-wedding reception at Buckingham Palace which was attended by heads of Government and many members of European Royalty. \r\nIn 1985 Errol left the band and took time out to spend more time with his wife and then young children, resurfacing in 1990 and 1993 to embark on successful solo tours of the UK. He helped with the promotion of the classic single \"You Sexy Thing\" which was featured in the movie 'The Full Monty' and re-released by EMI Records in 1997. A new Hot Chocolate 'Greatest Hits' compilation released in October 1997 reached number 10 in the album charts the next month. Errol also performed live on 'Top Of The Pops' as the single reached the number 6 position. Hot Chocolate hit the charts again in February 1998 when EMI reissued the single, \"It Started With A Kiss\" and appeared on TOTP again. \r\nThe same year Errol completed a sell out 58 date UK tour, which included an outstanding performance at the London Palladium in May. July 98 saw Errol on an extensive promotion tour of concerts, television/radio and media appearances throughout Germany having topped the bill at The Frankfurt Festival where he played to an audience of over 300,000. In 1999 Errol embarked on a very successful tour across the UK of 69 concerts. In the Queen's birthday honours list of June 2003 Errol was awarded an MBE by the Queen for \"services to popular music\". The investiture took place on Nov 27th 2003. \r\nErrol stated - \"I would like to say how very proud and moved I was to be honoured with an MBE\". In 2004 Errol received the Ivor Novello award.\r\n",
